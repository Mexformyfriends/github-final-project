Simple Interest Calculator

Overview
This is a simple interest calculator that calculates the simple interest based on the provided principal amount, time period in years, and annual rate of interest.

Usage
To use the calculator, provide the following inputs:

Principal Amount (p): The initial amount of money.
Time Period (t): The time period in years.
Annual Rate of Interest (r): The annual interest rate.
Formula
The simple interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

arduino
Copy code
Simple Interest (SI) = p * t * r
Example
python
Copy code
# Example values
principal_amount = 1000
time_period = 2
annual_interest_rate = 5

# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = principal_amount * time_period * annual_interest_rate

# Output the result
print(f"Principal Amount: ${principal_amount}")
print(f"Time Period: {time_period} years")
print(f"Annual Rate of Interest: {annual_interest_rate}%")
print(f"Simple Interest: ${simple_interest}")
Replace the example values with your own to calculate the simple interest for your specific case.

Feel free to integrate this calculator into your project or use it as a standalone tool for quick simple interest calculations.
